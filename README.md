# Book Review

## Highlights of this practice assessment:

1. All work was completed in under 2 hours

2. Only a single book object is being passed into the view

3. APIs are called through BookService and ReviewService

4. Services are instantiated through SearchResults poro

5. API information is combined in SearchResults into a single book object filled with result objects.

* Thought was that reviews belong to books, so they should be a book attribute, and the Search is what brings together books and reviews.

6. I took a different approach to this go-round and within 30 minutes had all information passed into the view and tests that I could rely on to guide my refactors.  It went much smoother this way because the 'work' was out of the way.
